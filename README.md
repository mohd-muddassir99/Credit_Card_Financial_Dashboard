## Introduction:- 
In this project, I developed a comprehensive Credit Card Transaction Dashboard using SQL and Power BI to analyze and visualize credit card transactions and customer data. The project involved several key stages, including data importation, database connection setup, data understanding and analysis using DAX queries, and dashboard creation with various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and visualizations.


## Project Objective⛳ :- 
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

- **Data Integration and Management**: Seamlessly integrate transaction and customer data into a unified platform for efficient analysis.

- **Dynamic Data Analysis**: Utilize DAX queries to perform dynamic calculations and gain deeper insights into customer behavior and transaction trends.

- **Visualization and Reporting**: Develop an interactive dashboard that provides stakeholders with clear and actionable insights through various KPIs and visualizations.

- **Performance Monitoring**: Track key financial metrics and customer-related statistics to monitor business performance and identify growth opportunities.

- **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers based on demographics and behavior to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.


## What I did in This Project🙆‍♂️ :-

- **Data Importation**: Imported transaction and customer datasets into a SQL database.
Ensured data integrity and accuracy during the import process.

- **Database Connection Setup**: Established a live connection between Power BI and the SQL database.
Configured automatic data refresh to keep the dashboard up-to-date with the latest data.

- **Data Analysis with DAX**: Wrote DAX queries to segment customers into age and income groups.
Calculated key metrics such as current week revenue, previous week revenue, and week-over-week (WoW) growth.
Derived additional insights like transaction counts and average customer income.

 Some DAX expression was written like;
 
>>1. **Age Group** 
 
       
    AgeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age]<30, "20-30",
    'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age]>= 30 && 'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age] < 40, "30-40",
    'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age]>= 40 && 'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age] < 50, "40-50",
    'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age]>= 50 && 'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age] < 60, "50-60",
    'ccdb cust_detail'[Customer_Age]>= 60 ,"60+",
    "UNKNOWN"
    )

>>2. **Income Group** 
 
       
    IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'ccdb cust_detail'[Income] < 35000, "Low",
    'ccdb cust_detail'[Income] >= 35000 && 'ccdb cust_detail'[Income] < 70000, "Mid",
    'ccdb cust_detail'[Income] >= 70000, "High",
    "Unknown"
    )

>>3. **Current Week Revenue** 
 
       
    Cur_week_Rev = CALCULATE(
    SUM('ccdb credit_card_details'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('ccdb credit_card_details'),
        'ccdb credit_card_details'[Week_Num2] = MAX('ccdb credit_card_details'[Week_Num2])))
    
>>4. **Previous Week Revenue** 
 
    Previous_week_Rev = CALCULATE(
    SUM('ccdb credit_card_details'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('ccdb credit_card_details'),
        'ccdb credit_card_details'[Week_Num2] = MAX('ccdb credit_card_details'[Week_Num2])-1))

>>5. **WoW Growth** 
 
     WoW_Revenue_Change = DIVIDE(([Cur_week_Rev] - [Previous_week_Rev]),[Previous_week_Rev])

- **Dashboard Creation**: Created a user-friendly and interactive dashboard in Power BI.
Incorporated KPIs such as total revenue, transaction amount, interest earned, count of transactions, average customer income, customer satisfaction score, and customer acquisition cost.

**Designed various charts to visualize data insights, including**:
